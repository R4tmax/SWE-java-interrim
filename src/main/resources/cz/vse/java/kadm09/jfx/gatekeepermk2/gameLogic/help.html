<h1>GATEKEEPERMK2</h1>
<h2>What is the game about?</h2>
<p>Game loosely interprets the story from my personal novel
currently titled GATEKEEPER, that I am writing in my spare time.</p>

<h2>How to play the game?</h2>
<h3>Player character</h3>
<p>The game is played from the perspective of an anonymous knight. Who besides being clad in
plate armour and wielding a greatsword. Is also a capable mage.
Furthermore, the player character can withstand usage of potions and herbs and modify his gear
in the field</p>

<h3>Basic input</h3>
<p>This variant of the game accepts input through the text field at the bottom of the panel.
Game returns output into the text area in the right top.
At any given moment, available commands can be accessed by typing HELP into the text field.
I suggest hitting HELP whenerver you are not sure how to continue. Also, take time to learn the commands
At the start of the game!.
Incorrect inputs are ignored and warning given to the player.</p>

<p>There are two main areas to pay attention to.
Player stats are always visible on the left screen, gamestate is always displayed on the icons in the middle of
the screen. These icons correlate to the expected inputs, pay attention to them!
If your health drops below 0, you die!</p>
